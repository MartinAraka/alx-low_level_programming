A hash table is a data structure that efficiently stores key-value pairs, allowing for fast retrieval of values given a key. It works by using a hash function to compute an index where the value will be stored or retrieved. This enables constant-time average case complexity for insertion, deletion, and lookup operations, making hash tables a fundamental tool for implementing associative arrays, databases, caches, and more in computer science and software engineering.
