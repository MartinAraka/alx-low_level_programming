This file provides an introduction to Makefiles, a tool used for automating the build process in software development. Makefiles consist of rules that define how source code files are compiled and linked into executable programs or libraries. By specifying dependencies and commands, Makefiles streamline the compilation process, ensuring that only necessary files are rebuilt when changes occur. Makefiles are especially useful for managing projects with multiple source files or complex build requirements. This README.md offers a basic overview of Makefiles, their syntax, and their role in simplifying software development workflows.
